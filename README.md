## ABOUT

This is an up-to-date version of TrinityCore's World Database. Our updates are ours and not pulled from TrinityCore for specific reasons. EDB will be updated with TrinityCore's commits every week to ensure our structure is consistent with theirs.

Our update process is much more user-friendly. Rather than you having to search through to find the correct update, we'll have update queries. We also will update the main tables, along with keeping our updates available for only 1 week and then they will be taken down to keep from having a massive mess. Updates during the 1 week period will be in one SQL file only.

Currently on [b5afe64b44bc425a15376a1180ff5e63073a0d0] (https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/commit/b5afe64b44bc425a15376a1180ff5e63073a0d0)

## INFORMATION

If you're installing our fresh tables, then you don't need to run ANY updates in the updates/ folder. You should only run updates if you already have our tables and want to update.
